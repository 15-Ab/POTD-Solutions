# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- Recursive Structure :
- - This problem likely involves constructing a structure consisting of "khali" (empty) and "makan" (occupied) units in a certain pattern.
- Dynamic Programming :
- - I should use dynamic programming to iteratively calculate the total number of ways to construct the building structure.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialization :
- - The base case is handled separately: if N is 1, there is only one way to construct the structure with 4 units (as indicated by the return 4; statement).
- Iterative Dynamic Programming :
- - The code then iterates from i = 1 to i = N-1, updating the counts for "khali" and "makan" units.
- - 'khali' and 'makan' represent the counts of empty and occupied ( building ) units at the current step, respectively.
- Calculation of Total Ways :
- - After the loop, 'ektrfka' represents the total number of ways to construct the structure with N units. ( sum of total number of ways of both buildings and space : of one side of road )
- - 'donotrfka' is calculated as the square of 'ektrfka' ( as each combination will have as much permutation on other side of road ).

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $$O(N-1)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Space complexity : $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->


# Code
```
class Solution
{
    static int mod = 1_000_000_007;
    
    public int TotalWays(int N){
        // Code here
        if( N == 1){
            return 4;
        }
        int khali = 1;    // to store empty spaces ways till now
        int makan = 1;    // to store ways to store buildings till now
        int pichla_khali ; // to keep track of previous number of ways of empty spaces
        int pichla_makan ; // to keep track of previous number of ways of buildings
        for( int i = 1; i < N; i++){
            pichla_khali = khali;    // updaing previous ways to current one
            pichla_makan = makan;    // updaing previous ways to current one
            
            khali = ( pichla_makan + pichla_khali ) % mod; // as a plot can be left empty if previous plot is either empty or have building
            makan = pichla_khali % mod;       // as building can only be possible if previous plot is empty
        }
        
        long ektrfka = ( khali + makan ) % mod;   // sum of total number of ways of both buildings and space : of one side of road
        long donotrfka = ( ektrfka * ektrfka ) % mod;  // as each combination will have as much permutation on other side of road 
        
        return (int)donotrfka;
    }
