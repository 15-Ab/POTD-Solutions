## Delete without head pointer

## Intuition
The goal is to delete a node from a singly linked list given only access to that node (`del_node`). Deleting a node usually requires access to the previous node as well, but in this case, we only have access to the node to be deleted. 

## Approach

**Special Cases Handling :**
   - First, I checked if the given node to be deleted (`del_node`) is null. If it is null, it implied that the linked list is empty, so there's nothing to delete.
   - Next, I checked if the next node of `del_node` is null. If it is null, it means `del_node` is the last node of the linked list. In this case, I cannot directly delete `del_node`, so I returned without performing any deletion.

**Copy Data and Update Pointers :**
   - If neither of the above special cases holds true, it meant `del_node` is neither null nor the last node of the linked list.
   - To delete `del_node`, I copied the data from its next node to `del_node`. This effectively maked `del_node` contain the data of its next node.
   - Next, I updated the `next` pointer of `del_node` to skip the next node and point directly to the node after the next node. This effectively removed the next node from the linked list.

My approach allows to delete a node from a singly linked list given only access to that node, without needing access to the previous node.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( 1 )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->

- Space complexity : $O( 1 )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
//  User function Template for Java

/*
class Node
{
	int data ;
	Node next;
	Node(int d)
	{
		data = d;
		next = null;
	}
}
*/

//Function to delete a node without any reference to head pointer.
class Solution
{
    void deleteNode(Node del_node)
    {
        // Your code here
        
        // Checking if the linked list is empty
        if(del_node == null)
            return; 
        
        // Checking if del_node is the last node
        if(del_node.next == null)
            return; 

        // Copying data from the next node to del_node
        del_node.data = del_node.next.data;

        // Updating pointers to delete the next node
        del_node.next = del_node.next.next;
    }
}
```
