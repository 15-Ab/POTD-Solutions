## Find shortest safe route in a matrix

## Intuition
An additive sequence is a series of numbers in which each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The idea behind the algorithm is to explore all possible combinations of the first two numbers in the sequence and then recursively check if the remaining string forms a valid additive sequence.

## Approach

**Input Validation :** I checked if the length of the input string is less than or equal to 2. If so, return false as an additive sequence must contain at least three numbers.
- **Initialization :** Initialized two static variables `jawab` (result) and `sequence` (to store the current sequence being checked).
- **Recursion :** Defined a recursive function `checkAdditive` that takes the input string and the starting index as parameters.
- **Base Case :** If the starting index equals the length of the input string and the size of the sequence is greater than 2, set the result to true.
- **Updated Variables :** Updated variables `first`, `second`, and `current` based on the current state of the sequence.
- **Iterated :** Iterated through the remaining characters in the input string starting from the current index.
- **Backtracking :** Added the current number to the sequence if the sequence size is less than 2 and the result is not true. Recursively call the `checkAdditive` function with the updated parameters. Removed the current number from the sequence to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
- **Checked Conditions :** Checked if the current number violates the additive property or if it satisfies the additive property. Return or continue accordingly.
- **Result :** After exploring all possibilities, returned the final result.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( N^2 )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$N$ : length of the input string
- Space complexity : $O( N )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
