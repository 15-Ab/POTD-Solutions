## Today's 04-04-24 [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-all-substrings-of-a-number-1587115621/1)
## Sum of all substrings of a number

## Intuition
-  I want to efficiently find the sum of all substrings of a given string.

## Approach
- I initialized variables for modulus, partial sum array, and final answer.
- Iterated through each character of the string.
- Calculated the partial sum for each index using dynamic programming.
- Updated the final answer accordingly.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(l)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$l$ : length of the string

- Space complexity : $O(l)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
//  User function Template for Java

class Solution
{
    // Declaring a static variable to store the modulus value.
    static long mod = 1_000_000_007;
    // Declaring an array to store the partial sum of substrings.
    static long[] gp;
    // Declaring a variable to store the final answer.
    static long jawab;
    
    // Function to find sum of all possible substrings of the given string.
    public static long sumSubstrings(String s) {
        
        // Initializing the partial sum array with the same length as the string.
        gp = new long[s.length()];
        // Initializing the first element of the partial sum array with the value of the first character in the string.
        gp[0] = s.charAt(0) - '0';
        // Initializing the final answer with the value of the first element in the partial sum array.
        jawab = gp[0];
        
        // Iterating through the characters of the string starting from the second character.
        for(int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++){
            
            // Getting the current character.
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            // Calculating the partial sum for the current index using the formula.
            gp[i] = ( ( gp[i-1] * 10 ) % mod + ( ( c - '0' ) * ( i + 1 ) ) % mod ) % mod;
            // Updating the final answer by adding the partial sum for the current index.
            jawab = ( jawab + gp[i] ) % mod;
        }
        
        // Returning the final answer.
        return jawab;
    }
}
