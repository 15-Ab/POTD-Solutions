## Longest subarray with sum divisible by K

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
My code aims to find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is divisible by a given integer 'k'. My solution leverages the concept of cumulative sum and utilizes a HashMap to efficiently track remainders of cumulative sums.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**Initialization:**
   - Initialized variables, including `longest` to store the length of the longest subarray, and a HashMap `m` to store remainders and their corresponding indices.

**Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - Iterated through the array, maintaining a cumulative sum `jor` at each index.

**Remainder Calculation:**
   - Calculated the remainder after dividing the cumulative sum `jor` by \( k \).

**Conditions:**
   - If the remainder is zero, it implies that the subarray from the beginning to the current index is divisible by \( k \). Updated the `longest` variable accordingly.
   - If the remainder is already present in the HashMap, it means that the subarray between the current index and the index stored in the HashMap has a sum divisible by \( k \). Update the `longest` variable if needed.
   - If the remainder is not present in the HashMap, added it to the HashMap along with its index.

**Result:**
   - The `longest` variable stores the length of the longest subarray whose sum is divisible by \( k \).

                // If the remainder is already present in the HashMap, updated the longest subarray length
                longest = Math.max(longest, i - m.get(remainder));

                // If the remainder is not present, added it to the HashMap along with its index
                m.put(remainder, i);
