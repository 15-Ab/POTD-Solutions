## Implement Atoi

## Intuition

The goal is to convert a given string to an integer, considering various cases such as signs, whitespaces, and invalid characters.


## Approach

- Removed the leading and trailing whitespaces from the input string.
- If the string is empty after stripping, returned -1 (invalid input).
- Determined the sign of the number (positive or negative) based on the first character.
- If the first character is a sign (+ or -), removed it from the string.
- Initialized a variable 'jawab' to store the final integer value.
- Iterated through each character in the string.
  - Checked if the character is a digit.
  - Updated the result by multiplying it by 10 and adding the digit.
  - If a non-digit character is encountered, returned -1 (invalid input).
- Applied the sign to the `jawab`.
- Returned the final integer value.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(s)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$s$ :  length of the input string.

- Space complexity : $O(s)$ ( extra space required for the stripped string )
  
  Don't worry, stripping the string isn't necessary here beacuse it isn't given that there may be leading and trailing whitespaces.
  I have used stripping here so that I keep in mind that in similar questions it may be required.

  So in this question, stripping can be skipped, then the space complexity will be $O(1)$ as asked in question.
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code 
```
//User function template for JAVA

/*You are required to complete this method */
class Solution {
    
    // Method to convert a string to an integer (atoi)
    int atoi(String s) {
        // Removing leading and trailing whitespaces from the string
        s = s.strip();

        // If the string is empty after stripping, returning -1
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Determining the sign of the number (positive or negative)
        int sign = s.charAt(0) == '-' ? -1 : 1;

        // If the first character is a sign (+ or -), removing it from the string
        if (s.charAt(0) == '-' || s.charAt(0) == '+') {
            s = s.substring(1);
        }

        // Initializing a variable to store the result
        int jawab = 0;

        // Iterating through each character in the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            // Checking if the character is a digit
            if (!Character.isDigit(c)) {
                // If not a digit, returning -1 (invalid input)
                return -1;
            }

            // Updating the result by multiplying it by 10 and adding the digit
            jawab = jawab * 10 + (c - '0');
        }

        // Applying the sign to the result and cast it to an integer
        return sign * jawab;
    }
}
```
