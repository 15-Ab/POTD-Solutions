# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Need to keep track of occurences of bits.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialization:
- - 'ekbaar' and 'dobaar' are initialized to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the bits that have appeared once and twice so far.
- Bitwise XOR in the Loop :
- - The code iterates through each number in the array using a for-each loop.
- - The key idea is to use XOR operations to keep track of the bits in 'ekbaar' and 'dobaar'.
- - For each number (num) :
- - - 'ekbaar' ^= (num & ~'dobaar') : XOR the current 'ekbaar' with the bit representation of num after excluding the bits that are also in 'dobaar'.
- - - dobaar ^= (num & ~'ekbaar'): XOR the current 'dobaar' with the bit representation of num after excluding the bits that are also in 'ekbaar'.
- Explanation of XOR Operations :
- - XORing with num & ~dobaar means updating the 'ekbaar' variable by XORing it with the bits that are in num but not in 'dobaar'.
- - XORing with num & ~ekbaar means updating the 'dobaar' variable by XORing it with the bits that are in num but not in 'ekbaar'.
- Result :
- - The final result is stored in 'ekbaar'. After iterating through all the numbers, 'ekbaar' will contain the bit representation of the unique element that appears only once.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ekbaar = 0; // to store bits occuring once
        int dobaar = 0; // to store bits occuring twice
        for( int i : nums){
            ekbaar = ekbaar ^ ( i & ~ dobaar); // updating the 'once' variable by XORing it with the bits that are in 'i' but not in 'twice'.
            dobaar = dobaar ^ ( i & ~ ekbaar); // updating the 'twice' variable by XORing it with the bits that are in 'i' but not in 'once'.
        }

        return ekbaar; // as this stores the numer( bits) occuring once
    }
}
