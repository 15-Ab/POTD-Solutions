## Linked List that is Sorted Alternatingly

## Intuition
We are given a singly linked list and tasked with sorting it in ascending order using a special sorting algorithm. My algorithm splits the list into two lists: one in ascending order and the other in descending order, then merges them while sorting.

## Approach

**Splitted the List** :
   - I started by creating two dummy nodes, `ascendingHead` and `descendingHead`, which will serve as heads for the ascending and descending lists, respectively.
   - I then traverse the original list, linking alternate nodes to the ascending and descending lists.
   - After traversing, I terminated both lists by setting the `next` pointers of their last nodes to `null`.

**Reversed the Descending List** :
   - I reversed the descending list to ensure that both lists are sorted in ascending order for merging.

**Merged the Lists** :
   - I merged the two sorted lists into one sorted list by repeatedly selecting the smaller of the two current nodes from the heads of the ascending and descending lists.
   - I iterated through both lists, comparing their nodes and appending the smaller node to the merged list.
   - Once one of the lists is exhausted, I appended the remaining nodes of the other list to the merged list.

**Returned the Sorted List** :
   - Finally, I returned the head of the merged list as the sorted list.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( n )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$n$ : number of nodes in the original list

- Space complexity : $O( 1 )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
