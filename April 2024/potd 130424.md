## Reverse Bits

## Intuition
Given a number `x`, I aim to reverse its binary representation and return the result in decimal form.

## Approach

**Iterated over Bits** : 
- I iterated over the 32 bits of `x`.
- For each bit, right shift `x` to obtain the rightmost bit, then left shift the result by 1 and add the obtained bit.

**Result** : 
- The result after iterating over all bits is the reversed binary representation of `x` in decimal form.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(log(x))$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$x$ : given
- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
//  User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    static Long reversedBits(Long x) {
        
        long jawab = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            
            // Get the rightmost bit of x and add it to jawab
            jawab = (jawab << 1) | (x & 1);
            
            // Right shift x to get the next bit
            x >>= 1;
        }
        return jawab;
    }
};
