## Maximum Index

## Intuition
The goal is to find the maximum index difference between two elements, where the element on the left is smaller than or equal to the element on the right. This can be achieved by maintaining an array (`lMin`) that stores the minimum value from the left side for each element in the input array (`a`). By comparing each element in `a` with its corresponding minimum from the left, we can determine the maximum index difference.

## Approach

**I initialized Left Minimum Array (`lMin`) :**
   - Created a static array `lMin` to store the minimum value from the left side.
   - Set the first element of `lMin` as the first element of the input array.

**Fill Left Minimum Array (`lMin`) :**
   - Used a loop to iterate through the input array from the second element onwards.
   - For each element, updated the corresponding element in `lMin` with the minimum of the previous `lMin` element and the current element from the input array.

**Initialized Variables :**
   - Initialized a variable `jawab` with the minimum integer value. This variable will store the final answer for the maximum index difference.

**Found Maximum Index Difference :**
   - Used two pointers (`i` and `j`) starting from the end of the array.
   - Iterated through the array and compare the current element from the input array (`a[j]`) with the corresponding minimum from the left (`lMin[i]`).
   - If the current element from the input array is greater than or equal to the corresponding minimum from the left :
     - Updated the answer (`jawab`) with the maximum of its current value and the difference between `j` and `i`.
     - Moved to the next element from the left (`i`).
   - If the condition is not satisfied, moved to the next element from the input array (`j`).

**Result :**
   - The final answer for the maximum index difference is stored in the variable `jawab`. Return this value as the result of the function.

My approach ensured that I find the maximum index difference satisfying the given condition efficiently.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( N )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$N$ : size of the input array
- Space complexity : $O( N )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

        // Setting the first element of lMin as the first element of the input array.
        lMin[0] = a[0];
        
        // Loop to fill the lMin array with minimum values from the left side.
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
          lMin[i] = Math.min(lMin[i - 1] , a[i]);

        // Initializing the jawab variable with the minimum integer value.
        jawab = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        // Initializing two pointers for comparison.
        int i = n - 1, j = n - 1;

        // Loop to find the maximum index difference.
        while(i >= 0 && j >= 0){
            
          // Checking if the current element from the original array is greater than or equal to the corresponding minimum from the left side.
          if(a[j] >= lMin[i]){
            
            // Updating the answer if the condition is satisfied.
            jawab = Math.max( jawab, j - i );
            
            // Moving to the next element from the left side.
            i--;
          }
          else{
            // If the condition is not satisfied, move to the next element from the original array.
            j--;
          }
        }

        // Returning the final answer.
        return jawab;
    }
}
