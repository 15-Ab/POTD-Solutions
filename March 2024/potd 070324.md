## Longest repeating and non-overlapping substring

## Intuition
Given a string `s` of length `n`, the task is to find the longest substring with repeating characters.

## Approach

To find the longest repeating substring, my provided solution used a dynamic programming approach with a two-dimensional array `lcs` to store the lengths of common substrings.

- If the length of the string is 1, returned "-1" as there is no repeating substring in a single-character string.

- Initialized the `lcs` array to store the lengths of common substrings and variables (`jawab`, `jawabL`, `in`) to store the final answer.

- Used nested loops to iterate over the string characters and populate the `lcs` array based on matching characters.

- Updated the `jawab` and related variables whenever a longer repeating substring is found.

- Built the longest repeating substring using the stored information.

- Returned the final answer.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O( n^2 )$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$n$ : length of the input string `s`
- Space complexity : $O( n^2 )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
//  User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    
    // Static array to store the lengths of common substrings
    static int lcs[][];
    
    // Variable to store the final answer
    static String jawab;
    
    // Function to find the longest substring with repeating characters
    static String longestSubstring(String s, int n) {
        // Code here
        
        // Special case : If the string has only one character, there is no repeating substring
        if( n == 1){
            return "-1";
        }
        
        // Initializing the array to store lengths of common substrings
        lcs = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
 
        // Initializing variables for the final answer
        jawab = "";
        int jawabL = 0;
        int in = 0;
        
        // Dynamic programming approach to find the lengths of common substrings
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i - 1) == s.charAt(j - 1) && lcs[i - 1][j - 1] < (j - i)) {
                    lcs[i][j] = lcs[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                    if (lcs[i][j] > jawabL) {
                        jawabL = lcs[i][j];
                        in = Math.max(i, in);
                    }
                } 
                else {
                    lcs[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        // Building the longest repeating substring using the stored information
        if (jawabL > 0) {
            for (int i = in - jawabL + 1; i <= in; i++) {
                jawab += s.charAt(i - 1);
            }
        }
 
        // Returning the final answer
        return jawab;
    }
    
};
