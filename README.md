## Possible Paths in a Tree

## Intuition
The given code implements a solution to find the maximum weighted edge for each query in a disjoint set data structure (also known as union-find or merge-find data structure). The problem involves processing a series of weighted edges and answering queries based on a weight threshold.


## Approach

**Disjoint Set Initialization** :
- I initialized the parent and size arrays for the disjoint set.
- Each node is initially its own parent, and the size of each set is set to 1.

**Processing Weighted Edges** :
- Sorted the given edges based on their weights in ascending order.
- For each edge in the sorted list :
  - Finded the roots of the two nodes connected by the edge using the `findRoot` method.
  - If the roots are different, performed union of the two nodes using the `union` method.
  - Updated the `result` variable with the sum of squares of sizes of the merged sets.

**Stored Results** :
- Used a TreeMap to store the result for each weight threshold encountered during the processing of edges.
- For each query weight :
  - Finded the closest weight threshold less than or equal to the query weight using the `floorEntry` method of TreeMap.
  - If no such weight threshold exists, added 0 to the result list; otherwise, add the corresponding result to the list.

**Results** :
- Returned the list containing the results for each query.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $ O(n log n + q log n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->
$n$ :  number of edges 

$q$ : number of queries
- Space complexity : $O( n )$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
