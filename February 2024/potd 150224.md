## Count all Possible Path

## Intuition
The goal is to determine if it is possible for each path in a 2D array to have an even sum. This involved checking the sum of elements in each row and verifying whether the sum is even or not.

## Approach

**Iterated Through Paths** : 
- Looped through each path in the 2D array.

**Calculated Sum** : 
- For each path, calculated the sum of its elements by iterating through them.

**Checked Sum Parity** :
- Checked if the sum obtained is even. If the sum is not even, returned 0, indicating that it is not possible for that specific path.

**Final Result** : 
- If all paths have even sums, returned 1, indicating that it is possible for each path to have an even sum.

My approach ensured that the code checked each path individually and returned the final result based on whether it is possible for all paths to have even sums or not.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

Keep Solving.:)

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(r * c)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->

$r$ : number of rows in the 2D `paths` array 

$c$ : number of columns in the 2D `paths` array 

- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
## Code 

```
// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    
    // Function to check if it is possible for each path to have an even sum
    public int isPossible(int[][] paths) {
        // Code here

        // Iterating through each path
        for (int[] rasta : paths) {
            int sum = 0;

            // Calculating the sum of elements in the current path
            for (int val : rasta) {
                sum += val;
            }

            // Checking if the sum is not even
            if (sum % 2 != 0) {
                // If the sum is not even, returning 0 (indicating it is not possible)
                return 0;
            }
        }

        // If all paths have even sums, returning 1 (indicating it is possible)
        return 1;
    }
}
```
